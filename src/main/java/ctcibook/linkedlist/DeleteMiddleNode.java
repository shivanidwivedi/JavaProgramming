 * Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle of a singly linked list, given
 * only access to that node.
 *
 * Note that this problem cannot be solved if the node to be deleted is the last node in
 * the linked list. That's okâ€”your interviewer wants you to point that out, and to discuss
 * how to handle this case. You could, for example, consider marking the node as dummy
